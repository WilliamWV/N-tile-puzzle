# N-tile-puzzle
solver to 8-tile or 15-tile puzzle problem

Implementation of state-space search algorithms to find solution to n-tile puzzle. Project developed to UFRGS' artificial intelligence planning course.
The A* algorithm was optimized to be able to solve most instances of the avaliation and use a customized open list to store states.
